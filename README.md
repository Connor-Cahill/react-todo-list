# React Todo App
This was a simple Todo List app created with React. The purpose of building this was to better familiarize myself with using React. Through building this app I worked more with how react components work, managing state(for using the todo items), and giving our components functionality. I also got to play around with animations, using the React Flip Move npm package.
